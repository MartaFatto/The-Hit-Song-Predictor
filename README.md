# The Hit Song Predictor

## Overview

Our work is inspired by the so called *Hit Song Science*, whose pioneer is the music entrepreneur Mike McCready. The Hit Song Science aims at predicting whether a song will be a hit before its distribution, by analyzing its audio features through machine learning algorithms. 

Research question: *"Can we accurately predict whether a song will be a hit knowing some of its audio features?"* 

Statistical Learning and Machine Learning techniques for classifications:
* Logistic Regression, Lasso Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision trees
* Random Forests
